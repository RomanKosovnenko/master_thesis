I would like to take this opportunity to express my immense gratitude to all those who given their invaluable support and assistance.

I wish to express my deepest gratitude to my supervisors M.Sc. Dmytro Pukhkaiev, Dipl.-Inf. Johannes Mey and Dr.-Ing. Sebastian GÃ¶tz, who convincingly guided and encouraged me to do the right thing even when the road got tough. Without their persistent help, the goal of this thesis would not have been achieved.

I am extremely grateful to my parents for their love,  support, and faith in my decisions.  Also, I express my thanks to my sister for her support. 

Last but not least, I would like to thank my friends and the people around me. They all kept me going.
