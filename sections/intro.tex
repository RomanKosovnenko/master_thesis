\chapter{Introduction}\label{intro}
Many optimization problems could be solved using evolutionary programming (e.g. Genetic Algorithm). 

\section{Motivation}
- 


\section{Objective}
The objective of this thesis is to improve a previously developed genetic optimization approach by carefully tuning its parameters. The research objective is to identify and/or introduce parameters that can significantly influence the quality of the obtained solution, improve performance and increase scalability of the genetic optimization approach. From this goals two research questions are formulated:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{RQ1}: Were there any wrong architectural decisions in the genetic solver?
	\item \textbf{RQ2}: Does the tuning parameter affect the result?
\end{itemize}



  	
\section{Overview}
\todo{The description of this thesis is organized as follows: In Chapter 2, we extend not advanced in field of problem solving and optimizations reader by background knowledge and defines scope of thesis. Chapter 3 describes related work in defined scope. In Chapter 4 one will find the concept description of dynamic heuristics selection. Chapter 5 contains more detailed information about approach implementation and  embedding it to BRISE. The evaluation results and analysis could be found in Chapter 6. Finally, Chapter 7 concludes the thesis and Chapter 8 describe the future work.}
