\section{Overview}
\todo{The description of this thesis is organized as follows: In Chapter 2, we extend not advanced in field of problem solving and optimizations reader by background knowledge and defines scope of thesis. Chapter 3 describes related work in defined scope. In Chapter 4 one will find the concept description of dynamic heuristics selection. Chapter 5 contains more detailed information about approach implementation and  embedding it to BRISE. The evaluation results and analysis could be found in Chapter 6. Finally, Chapter 7 concludes the thesis and Chapter 8 describe the future work.}
