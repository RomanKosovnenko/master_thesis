\chapter{Introduction}\label{intro}
The optimization problem occurs in all aspects of our life. There exist different methods to solve optimization problems. One of them is the evolutionary computing~(EC) approach. The evolutionary algorithms~(EAs) are part of EC. EAs could solve many optimization problems. It is especially useful when the user does know additional information about the problem. All algorithms of EAs are based on variants of operators and parameters. It means that parameter values could influence the solution of the optimization problem. This thesis describes parameter tuning and parameter analysis of the genetic optimization approach of solving a problem of software variant selection and hardware resource allocation.  

This chapter describes the motivation for parameter tuning and analysis of the genetic optimization approach and marks out research questions to be answered in this thesis. It additionally outlines a solution and contains an overview of the thesis structure.

\section{Motivation}
Researchers and developers know that good parameter values could improve the results of the algorithm. However, searching for optimized parameter values is another problem that needs to be solved. This problem is one of the persisting challenges of the EC field~\cite{smit2010parameter}. The main problem is that the specific EA contains unique design choices presented in the form of operators or its parameters. 

There exist many recommendations about what values are preferable~\cite{de2007parameter, sipper2018investigating}.  But in experimental researches~\cite{de2007parameter, shahookar1990genetic, gockel1997influencing}, these recommendations does not work. 

As a result, parameters need to be tuned. EAs have two approaches for parameter setting: parameter tuning and parameter control. Parameter control could change the parameter value during the EA work. Parameter tuning finds optimized values before EA starts.

According to~\cite{ahmad18}, the genetic optimization approach solves less number of problems than other approaches does. Optimized parameter values could improve the results. This thesis aims to overcome the gap between approaches and improve the genetic optimization approach using parameter tuning.


\section{Objective}
The goal of this thesis is to improve a previously developed genetic optimization approach using parameter tuning.
The research objective is to identify and/or introduce parameters that can improve the genetic optimization approach in terms of its performance and scalability and the quality of the obtained solution. We need to answer the following research questions in order to reach the research objective: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{RQ1}: Does the parameter tuning improve the results, and what effect does it give?
	\item \textbf{RQ2}: Were there any bad design choices in the genetic solver? Is there any way to improve it?
\end{itemize}

To answer these questions, we are using several methods that improve the genetic optimization approach. Moreover, we evaluate it on each stage. 

\section{Solution}

The suggested modifications improve the results of the genetic approach and consist of several steps.
The first step is searching for externally changeable parameters. These parameters we are optimizing. 
The second step is exposing parameters for external tuning because most parameters of the genetic solver are not exposed to external change.
Results at this point show that parameter tuning improves the result of the genetic solver, but for further improvement, it requires more modifications.
We introduce fine-grained crossover and mutation points by adding additional probabilities. Parameter tuning so far gives \textbf{valid results}. 

Due to the fact that the number of unique elements goes down on each iteration, we describe two methods to solve this issue.

Simple parameter control that stops the crossover if the part of unique elements in a population is lower than some value. This value is also a parameter. 
The population without duplicates is a second method to save population diversity. This method makes all individuals unique but slows down the solver.

The evaluation shows that fine-grained crossover/mutation points and parameter tuning give the best results for the genetic solver.
The results are improved not only in terms of solution validity but in terms of scalability.


\section{Overview}
