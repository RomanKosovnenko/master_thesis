\chapter{Evaluation and Analysis}

\section{Evaluation}
\subsection{Benchmark set}
which problems I try solve with GA

\subsection{Benchmark results}
\subsection{Compare with random solver}

\section{Analysis}
Why it works very bad!
\begin{itemize}
	\item Good parameter engineering 
	\item Self-adaptive software is not the best thing to optimize!
	\item GA is not the best idea for this kind of problem
\end{itemize}
