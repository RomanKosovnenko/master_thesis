\chapter{The way to get better results}

\todo{1 section contains two steps (Parameters and optimization) if available or only one?}
	
\section{Parameter tuning as a beginning of live}
Tuning of basic version of the genetic solver

\section{What if we could change magic numbers or Explain the code to ducks}
section about how we replace the hardcoded parameters...

\section{Astrologers have announced a week of probabilities. The number of probabilities doubled.}
section about new probabilities in Crossover and Mutation operators

\section{Rule34: optimize everything}
information how we optimize all parameters at this step

\section{Peppa Pig and adaptation for own life}
adaptive CrossoverRate and how it works

\section{Peppa Pig and life without cash as a result of optimal self-adaptation}
static tuning are good or not for adaptive parameters

\section{Unique genotypes is a God sign or placebo for genetic algorithms}
How works unique individuals in population

\section{As my grandfather said: "I am your optimization"}
info about results of optimization

\section{Bermuda Triangle and Missing Parameters}
MAYBE here will be information about not important parameters

\section*{Conclusion - Today we dried coals using the oven in Aleksandrovka}
Combination of different techniques and optimizations could give you a better results
